#GOL

Conway's Game of Life, in about 35 lines of Python.

##Features:

 - Adjustable grid size
 - Importable game class
 - not much else tbh but don't hate

Made in about five minutes to show my friend Jonathan that Python is actually the best and what is he doing being a law person when he could be playing with computers instead.
